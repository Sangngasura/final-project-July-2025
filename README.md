# 🌾 AgriMarket

**AgriMarket** is a web-based AgriTech platform that connects **farmers**, **buyers**, and **logistics providers** in one integrated system.  
It makes it easy for farmers to sell produce online, buyers to shop for farm goods, and admins to coordinate deliveries — all in a single, user-friendly interface.
